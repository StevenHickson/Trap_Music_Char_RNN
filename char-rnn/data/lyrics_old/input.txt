The feds tappin phones so I talk in code
The shit jumping out the gym I ain't talking pros
Polo on my draws, Bentley in my drive way
I was in the trap when you was on Myspace
Money on my mind state, increase the crime rate
Pinky Ring so big you can see it on the blind day
Car game irate, we park outside
SS on it and that's... for south side
Outside pulling, duice and the juices
Two two cups on me, shout out to Houston
We got a problem Houston, they take on style they boostin'
They Lame Man, they hoes knew it
They lame man, they hoes knewit

You can have a sip, if you gettin thirsty

Bust it for me baby girl, do the miss Parker
She super thick, my little college chick
Is she down the kiss another girl she with that freaky shit
Flex, I must admit show my ass like my breaks down when I'm on public

Hundred on my neck screaming bitch I got that check

Waka flocka hand a vip that bitch is acting up
Acking up, acking up, acking up, stacking up

[Quis]
Crispy
Crusin' down the mile blowing loud with my rich bitch
Steering with my left hand showing how my wrist glisten
Knew I'd come up again didn't think it be this quick
Shout out to them niggas that I used to hit licks with
7 mile better pile, been a man since a child
Used to be in school with my hands up a girl blouse
When my daddy went to jail
Ain't none of his boys come around
Or help me out when I was down so it's fuck them niggas now
Lames trying' to steal my style
Imitators everywhere
Think they can rock ice that Kid wouldn't let them near anywhere
No matter where the fuck I'm at I hold my chain in the air
They don't like 7 mile niggas but I don't care
Bitches stare when we in attendance
Pockets filled up with spinach
I love my life and all the people that's in it
Hold up wait for a minute
I got some shit to explain
We didn't reply to diss songs cause dem niggas was lame

[Doughboy Josh]
Ain't none of my niggas starving'
From Crispy Quis to Lil Marvin
If u still a broke nigga you must be retarded
Bronx style rolex
Quick like bowflex
A weak nigga grinding he getting no sex
O bitch mad at me she get no text

Off to FedEx, 200 to catch
I'm the boss lil dawg go and fetch

[Doughboy Payroll]
Aww shit fenkell in this bitch (4-1)
Keep the iron so I'm never wrinkled in this bitch
White diamonds looking like a kilo on my wrist
Ice cubes in my chain so I can debo me a bitch
They say we lying' in our raps nigga tell that to the feds
Haters say a nigga broke bitch tell that to my bread (fuck on)
Ain't nothing change but the quality of ice
And I wear Louie every day like niggas wear knives
I'ma cash-out rich nigga (bitch)

It could be just ten or a hundred of them shits
Them bitches getting flipped vacuum seals getting ripped

[Doughboy HBK]
YAE YAE
All these niggas hating' tell me one thing what yo pockets bout
Thats why yo main bitch can't wait till my nigga roc get out
My braclet for your life
My nigga I wouldn't even swap it out
Everywhere I go I put the ave on and shouted out
Made a promise to myself im never going broke again
Ride past the club two times and make you choke again
Red bottles snake skin gucci nigga cobra skin
If I don't know nothing bitch best believe I know to win.

[Doughboy Clay]
In a clique full hustlers so getting money ain't an option
Stay going hard even though the feds watching
You say you getting money little boy you need to stop it
Took a trip with Don michaels came back with our apartment
How your ass getting money when ain't no grass in your yard
And you really walking light and you really bringing hard
Im a misbelieveing god nigga dope, gangs and drugs
Niggas fuck with DBC , because they know that we the plug.

[Doughboy Maine]
Brightmo maine

Bossed down bands two wrist's that just one hand

The night you wish for that's every other week for me
Damn my bitch such a freak well lets do it

Let a real nigga do it if u just gon' stand there
These bitches want money and I'm bout to make it rain here

[Doughboy Chaz]

Turning down mills from major deals

Nigga making diss songs don't nobody fucking care

DBC run the city nigga fuck anybody else
Stack for a feature nigga this ain't no joke
Pull up for a show impossible to go broke
All this ice on me make a bad bitch choke
Every bitch that suck me up gon' choke

[Doughboy Dre]
I got pounds of the Reggie balling like a pacer

Fucking with tip in the A drinking avian
So stop playing like you know us you don't know Delon
And you don't know me I get it by the whole p
Bad pretty bitch long hair, she wanna blow me
I blow up by the oz then call a couple thousand
The niggas keep hatin but my money keep piling
And my niggas be walling
My goons be tripping
40 on my hip nah bitch I'm never slippin' (never)

[VERSE 1]
Niggas been walking around the city like they a king
How you a king? If you don't got no soldiers to do a thing
15 bottles of mo got em actin like they stacked
Waking up in the morning fucked up knowing your budget
Headfirst poppin them pills don't make you real
You dead? are a bunch of pussy niggas tryna build
A reputation our duct tape nation aint about faking
I'ma keep on going hard cause they want their souls taken

[HOOK]
                Yeah so what you got a little cake                 (X2)
It still don't change the fact that you niggas fake
You don't got it what it take to make it shake (you don't)
If it go down none of your people safe (they aint)
Why? You just a richer pussy, I know, I know, I know

[VERSE 2]
Aint doing it for your team just wanna be the one who's seen
In the spotlight I got a spotlight infrared beam
The women you knocking are just following
Tryna get a wrist band on club night
The club light got you twisted in the head moral sense is dead
Blind to whats really important she just want some Jordan
Money shouldn't make the man, man should make the money
A man compliment his ass seems kinda funny
Talking bout how muscular you think you are
That's some gay shit type of shit I don't play with
Get sprayed quick, this some real A shit
You think you getting well I'm come get it from your stainless steel and hit you up
Why? You just a richer pussy, I know, I know, I know

[HOOK] 
                Yeah so what you got a little cake                 (X2)

[VERSE 3]
I heard you got your bucks up but still will duck from us
Make you lil niggas scram I get to bucking bucks
Shots from the 12 g and it right next to me
You got a problem with trouble then just bring it to trouble
I get to bussin like I'm fucking with trojans
 That is your ? death is slowly approaching
Duct tape is the mob but we aint going no where
Been silent for the money we aint never been lame
Never had no niggas snitching on the fam
Momma ? Came back to where I am
Its just the way we were raised
You think what it take to be real is money, you'll be a richer pussy,
You'll be a richer pussy,you'll be a richer pussy,you'll be a richer pussy, you just a richer pussy

[HOOK] 
                Yeah so what you got a little cake                 (X2)

 [VERSE 1]
If you ain't got a dream, you ain't got nuttin'
A lot of niggaz changed on me when I got money
Said it come with the game and this what I wanted
So I'm a hustle like the first time, I got fronted for the love of the dream
And the Love of the team
Put Together, a circle, they couldn't come in-between
Went from lint in my pockets, to using money machines
I got my city back poppin' and they don't want me to leave
No, they don't want me to leave
But I gotta go and get it though
Time is money, and I'm on mission though
Poppy gotta eat, niggaz shootin' 'round my momma wait
Cops run in my sister crib, I swear I gotta find a way
Try to take the million dollars and I'm like a dime away
Never asked a nigga for a hand, I always grind away
Watch my little rats, smoke my little weed
Sold a little crack just to fill my little needs
I was 16, gettin' on my little knees
Askin' da lord please, help me get a little cheese
It was hot out, same time it was yard out
In a jungle where niggaz will rip your heart out
Cold summers where niggaz a bright starve out
Wanna be a kingpin from watch a nigga ball out
Could you blame us, devil was tryna chain us
We just tried to fix the roof leak when it was rainin'
We just tried to keep the house warm when winter came in
But they rub the detainers, lockers and cells of strangers, the razors
The animal go in cages, that's what the slave masters told the workers when they slaved us

[HOOK]
Small city, big dreams
I've been waiting on this day since I was 16
Since I was 16
I've been waiting on this day since I was 16

Small city, big dreams
I've been waiting on this day since I was 16
Since I was 16
I've been waiting on this day since I was 16

[VERSE 2]
Rock man told us sun don't shine
You know if his daddy hustled then his son gone grind
His father was locked up, now the son doin' time
When certain niggaz get to starvin' know that gun shine
Two felonies on his record, he got one more time
Get that, push that, he don't want no job, lost hope
Some niggaz don't even want no God
They just want a little money just to come through fly
Cause nobody ever listens to the broke nigga
Cause when you broke, be considered as a joke nigga
If you a joke, you consider as a hoe nigga
And no nigga wanna live like livin' poe nigga
Small city, big dreams
I've been waiting on this day since I was 16
Sellin white girl, I'm talkin' Christine
Young boy with dreams touching that big screen

[HOOK]
Small city, big dreams
I've been waiting on this day since I was 16
Since I was 16
I've been waiting on this day since I was 16

Small city, big dreams
I've been waiting on this day since I was 16
Since I was 16
I've been waiting on this day since I was 16

What kinda women you is? what kinda man you like
What kinda shit you like to do to make me feel alright
What kinda car you like to drive what kinda job you got
What kinda shit you like to buy what kinda fit you rock

[Verse 1 -Lil Phat]
? Drive a beamer or a bentley
Them rachet?  You just home independent
A businesswoman or a dentist a dancer you've been tricking
Not a big difference I just love women who tryna get it
From the bathroom to the living room to the kitchen
She claiming she be cooking hold it down we up in prison
Apartment , condo or a house you live in
You stay up in the lane so you like to shop ?
You keep your mouth closed because you dont like them in your business
You in love with just one nigga know they got plenty
You faithful and you taken you dont like fucking with many
Like a nigga in true religion jeans don't do the dishes
? A photo or a coupe
I aint gotta tell her she bad know she the truth
Facebook and twitter she still do it bigger
Ain't even gotta trip worry about my nigga


[HOOK X2]
What kinda women you is? what kinda man you like
What kinda shit you like to do to make me feel alright
What kinda car you like to drive what kinda job you got
What kinda shit you like to buy what kinda fit you rock
 
[Verse 2 - Lil Phat]
Eh hoes in your business huh playing on phones
?
Your man broke fuck you independent huh
You tell em fuck who you want you aint be tripping huh
Thats what Im talking bout
 I just like a women who like to keep herself together
Theres something bout a women who suck it you suck it better
Hands down you ain't fucking wit her because she better
One of them girl rappers got a bad bitch sweater
Like a nigga in the streets don't like be putting up with shit
I could be fucking with a hoe he probably cooking up a brick
Keep your friends out the mix they'll fuck up your relationship
I call her? when I'm leaning because I take sip
When she ride it like my fire when she dip
I give her a kiss when she trip
When I'm rocking the stage she rock my single
? Put your cup in the air if you're single

[HOOK X2]
What kinda women you is? what kinda man you like
What kinda shit you like to do to make me feel alright
What kinda car you like to drive what kinda job you got
What kinda shit you like to buy what kinda fit you rock

[Intro: Meek Mill]
One Night I prayed to God
I asked could he please remove the enemies from my life
And before you know it I started losing friends

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Y'all was like my brothers
I considered y'all as folks
And I remember nights sipping liquor making toasts
Talking about the life, trying to get it slinging dope
Niggas say I changed, but you niggas changed first
And fuck all this money nigga, we was fam first
Looking at me balling, know that Instagram hurt
Cuz you was supposed to be that nigga in that damn Ghost
I would have rolled for you even in the same herse
Same cemetary, burry me in the same dirt
We had a plan, but I guess it ain't work
"B.H we straight," that was the motto my nigga
I got rich first, you was supposed to follow my nigga
I'm gone

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
And Dat Nigga Lil
Shit I can't believe you (not you)
That's what that syrup and that weed do?
And when I came home I tried to feed you
And every song I was yellin free you (Free Dat Nigga Lil)
And if you bled I was down to bleed too
Now when I ride by I breeze through
I don't even stop, ain't a need to
And you the one that left nigga, I ain't leave you
Shit got realer, niggas got richer
I said the money train coming, niggas missed it
I even tried to spin back around to come and get you
But niggas wanted more from me then my own sister


[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
They want more than my mother
More than Omelly, and that nigga like my brother
Greedy motherfucker
Crazy thing about it, I don't hate em, I still love em
I might have said things, I never said fuck em
But I'm a live my life, get the money, ball hard
Still sending earned money for his calling cards
Rick ain't complaining, he got life behind bars
And he still calling me, bet you he ain't calling y'all
Cuz none of y'all niggas ain't send him shit yet
None of y'all niggas send him pics yet
I'm still writing money orders, sending big checks
And remember when it rains, niggas get wet
Gone

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around

[Outro: Meek Mill]
I still love niggas
But its like we just grew apart
If you don't grind, you don't shine
Half my niggas still around, and we all shining hard
Gone

[Chorus]
I want to love you
but if its not right, what can i do?
everything will be alright
so baby, get some sleep tonight

[Verse 1]
Uh, I wish we could just pretend to be
like we always were before we was happy as the Kennedys 
no one told jackie about Marilyn's tendencies
ignorance is bliss when you're married half a century
life is too short, trying to hold it all together
its gone before you blew it but tonight could last forever
i wrote it out on paper but forgot to mail the letter
you could walk away but you won't find nothing better
its whatever, i just hope that you remember
then i said some shit that upset her
arguing in public talking' loud as big sweater?? lol
she said, "you're always gone" i said "the fuck you'd expect from me?"
then she looked back and she said to me

[Chorus]
I want to love you
but if its not right, what can i do?
everything will be alright
so baby, get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2]
uh, maybe in some other lifetime
or somewhere down the road we might meet up at the right time
girls come with a profession when you write rhyme
caught me and she told me imma pig like i fight crime
well, maybe G is just an asshole
fuck around with bitches alfalfa little rascal
i swear my intentions aren't as evil as you think
but temptations always pushin people to the brink
fuck, i always lose my judgement when i drink
my only wish is that you settle down and hear me out
i know i haven't been completely honest and devote 
its difficult for me, these girls try to seek me out
i try to talk it out but this is all she speak about, she said]

[Chorus]
I want to love you
but if its not right, what can i do?
everything will be alright
so baby, get some sleep tonight

[Verse 3]
so if tonight turns out to be
the last night before you peaced and walked out on me
lets let it all hang out like a balcony 
one last time, the best is what you about to see
so make it worth it tonight
only so you know id never hurt you in spite 
love me like you never will again, this our last time
tonight, forget about the past time

Everything will be alright, so baby get some sleep tonight

[VERSE 1]
4 blunts to your brain baby snopp dogg
White girl wanna blame she from utah
We get it master kush from the weed clinic
That pretty car tinted thats me in it
Smoke weed everyday nate dogg
They say life is a game and I play hard
We from street rapping to the limelight
Couple G's on my neck and they shine bright
Dedicated to the critics who don't know me
I'm still the best player underated like Kobe
Hot till the day that I retire
We smokin on stress weed while choking on 5
I was 8 years in the streets picking low quarts
Can you see that was me in the dope spot
Run up on a nigga like me you hope not
My niggas gang bang and they'll aim at yo top

[HOOK]

Cali life changed cali life mayne (oooh its just that west coast livin)

[VERSE 2]
And there aint no tellin what mac luc sellin
California hustler Im a fly young fellon
Bag full of rock bout the size of a melon
Dolla sign on my eye money sign what I'm reppin
Pussy feel good but the cheddar feel better
Blowin smoke in the air so enough with the weather
Higher than a motherfuker I aint gotta do the leather
Hit the streets with a white tee whatever
Foreign kicks with some cargo shorts
Just let the ? we all going to smoke
L.A. is my city you can see it on my hat
Ballin through the supermall bitches starin at my tats
Its a fact that they starin at a mac
Cookin back at the crib they strain at the trap
Nigga looking at my hard must be starin at my hat
Approach my front lawn and they strain at my gat

Put a coat on a goat and a wig on a pig
 Better watch where you pimpin and kill
Criminals come and kidnap your bitch
Better watch your dress code B's and C's
All the other motherfukers copycats
I love cali like I love paper 
 Pocket full of blood money blue chuck taylor
Don't ever approach a gun fight swinging with a knife
 Bullets ignite on sight this the cali life
You can ball over night if you do it right
Hit the wrong gas station you could lose your life
Are you an agressor or a?
? low key cant handle the pressure
Keep if your head to the sky these niggas will test ya
Stashin dope real good these pigs will stretch ya

[Intro -The Weeknd]
She's about to earn some bragging rights
I'm 'bout to give it up like I've been holding back all night
Girl, take pride in what you want to do
Even if that means a new man every night inside of you
Baby, I don't mind
You can tell by how I roll
Cause my clique hard and my cup cold
My talk slurred cause I’m so throwed
And I'm wiping sweat from my last show
And he's TG and I'm XO
I'm only here for one night
Then I'mma be a memory
Say it in my ear, so I can hear what you're saying to me
I got cups full of that Rose
Smoke anything that's passed to me
Don't worry 'bout my voice
I won't need it for what I'm about to do to you

[Hook x2]
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

[Verse 1 - Wiz Khalifa]
Old rapping ass
Light years past the class
Hit it, don't have to pass
Nigga, we the new Aftermath
Niggas after fame, I just had to laugh
Niggas after fame, I'm after cash
You's a fan, I'm a player
I'm the man, you's a hater
And I only smoke papers
That's how you tell I'm Taylor'd
Nigga listen
Break it down, rolling weed on the island of my kitchen
And not a thing goes down without permission
Look, everything I got on I was made for
Everything that I got I done came for
All the shit that you see I done slaved for
All the cars and the crib, yeah that's paid for
Need I say more
Spend so much money on clothes
Said fuck a store, making my own
I hope that you're rolling one up while you're singing along
And know I was rolling one while I was making this song
Pour out some shots
You're taking too long
Young and I'm rich
And plus all of my friends on that Bombay and lemonade

[Hook x2]
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa]
I'm on some gin, you on some gin
I'm moving slow, I'm driving fast
I hit the weed, you take the wheel
We lose control
Drop the top in that 69
And that motor roar in that old Chevelle
Can’t say a thing, how you supposed to feel
Stacking all of this paper, dawg
I like to call this shit old news
It means haters jocking our old moves
Popping champagne cause we made it
Back of the Phantom, we faded
All of this shit that I did I probably won't remember tomorrow

[Hook x2]
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me


Wiz Khalifa- Remember You Ft. The Weekend Lyrics
hip hop lyrics
Wiz Khalifa Remember  you

[Chorus 2X: Gucci Mane]
I got trap money, I got trap-I got trap [2X]
I got 20 for a show, but it's really rap money
20 for a hoe and that's really trap money

[B.A.]
B.A.!!
Blue lights flashin, checkin out my mansion
Gangster so flashy, Louis Vuitton magnum
How he out here swaggin? Dat be what they askin
I drop the white crease, call it dope boy magic
Dopeology, you should take one of my classes
Hit me in the hood, red carpet, pants saggin
Rob you on Front Street in 75 classic
My potnahs know I'm good in the hood besides rappin
I got trap money cabin, it's 30 if you askin
D trap money lavish, ain't gotta make it rappin
Fruity bezel the cabbage, them country niggaz taxin
Ballin like Maverick, blowin loud in the traffic
I robbed a nigga twosie in some Rap Lord fashion
Say young'n in the hood, I'm a trap money addict
Cartier glasses, you see that I got money
I wake up early in the mornin I need me some trap money

[Chorus]

[Mook]
Mook!
20 Benz back, you see a nigga, that's my pack money
Look I ain't got no record deal so no it ain't no rap money
You see the stack in my jeans, I can't fit no rubber band
22 on cents, I'ma wrap it 'round them
And first I unload the tractor, bust 'em out the wrapper
Get 'em to my trappers and they bring me back them rat chicks
Bust off goin fast, you can call it cheetah girl
When I get the panky you know I'm water whippin her
No top on the whip, tank top Louis V
You can call me tank top cause all I do is wifebeat
Talkin smart on the phone, price just gone up
Take it or leave it homeboy, either way I give a fuck
Pot cold, LB's, kush by the O-Z's
Yeah I sell 'em for the low and get 'em for the dirt cheap
Get in just how you want, I'm a walkin trap sto'
Well connected nigga courtesy of my amigos
Flyin down 20 East, trunk full of dirty birdies
In the middle of the drought we let them bitches fly for 30
In the kitchen cuttin work I gotta do my two-step
Yeah I'm bad leg trappin, bring it to your front stop
Now I'm on Y-65, just got off I-10
In the handicap van, fill it up with midgets man
I mean the good I know is show and it ain't come from rappin money
Ten bands, all tens, nigga that's my trap money


Don't matter how far the road takes you
Nothing in this world can refresh your soul like being home
But a lot of niggas done sold they souls and made the wrong decision
So they can't come back home
So they try to find another source but it ain't nothing like love from the streets
I cherish these motherfuckin streets

I been on the road so long, I forgot what kind of cars I got
I rap so much I forgot what kind of bars I got
Rose in the concrete, rose to the top
Son of a gun, raised by a Glock
Georgia Power was off I was raised in the dark I don't know if it faze me or not
No telling
If I didn't turn 15 I wouldn't have been a felon (I bought it)
I bought the violence in my stick shift
If you don't shoot or get shot at you ain't go through adolescents
If you ain't go through all the pressure, You ain't get all of your blessings
What you know about not being able to re up going through depression
What you do about aggression, What you do about confession
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing

[Hook:]
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing

Crunching numbers with [?] heads
7 figures in Buckhead
I get dope too that's enough bread
Money tall so it's enough said
It was toom poom, Baby amp and big U stand for upset
I can tell you where the plug at he over there where my cuz at
Say I'm under the influence I was down stairs where the drugs at
40 cal, 50 cal, even my momma tote a pistol now
They call on that Crenshaw only thing we need is a mister child
You already know what this about, I shouldn't be riding around with this amount
Cause I can take your bitch with this amount
And take her on a trip with this amount
I look like a lick, act like I'm rich
Talk like a whip, walk like a brick
Fly like a blimp, right over the public
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing

[Hook:]
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing

Cummin' a bitch and I go crazy
Spend all these racks and I go crazy
Leave out the parking lot doin' a 180

Drop the top and start sun bathing
Put her on a treadmill and then I make her run naked
Got all my side hoe frustrated
This the life I waited on
Seen a bitch from school, gave her number to a payphone
I don't know what you been waiting on
All that I know is that I been waiting long

Provolone on top of Provolone
Mobile phone on top of mobile phone

You niggas so fake need assembly
I'm smokin' weed, fuck the penalty
Ridin' round in a old school, with 2 hoes and little old me
Fuck I'ma do wit this money, but walk in the club and start stuntin'
Push all my old bitches buttons
Came up from nothin' to something
Tell her take the stick, don't run from me
There's some for you, there's some for me
So if we have this 3 some, make sure you cum for me
All that bullshit is up under me, smokin' gas ain't no tumble weed
All of this cash that's another thing
Black and yellow like a bumblebee

Nigga you ain't used to winnin'
Had the chickens missing winters
In Miami, Mr. Winner
Ran a 14 for breakfast, prime 112 for dinner
Maison Margiela Killer
Got a heart of a killer
Take the pussy, I'll kill it

With my back against the wall ain't no pressure
When the defense really on, ain’t no test
Pull up real slow in a taxi
Gunshots turn em into athletes
I was hungry for a mil I gotta have it
Drove a couple couple cars up the mansion (Nah foreal at one time)
Smoked a whole seven sitting in the traffic
And niggas couldn't beat me if they practiced
Used to use my safe for a mattress
Used to use my mattress for a safe
See I could count a hundred thousand backwards (99, 98, 97.)
And I'm just tryna get it every day
They feigning for the trappers and the rappers [x3]

All these niggas never scared us
All these niggas never ran up
Bitch tryna put the head on me
Niggas tryna put the feds on me
Niggas tryna take meds on me

Sprinter van on me, I got them Zans on me
Driveway so damn long by the time I leave I'm damn asleep

I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr

I might buy a Maybach and paint it all gold, buy a crib fill the rooms up with all stoves
[?] pocket full of money [?]
I feel like I just paid off the plug, drop the top off the whip, hell I receive
High life nights so I woke up this evening, can't pimp me so don't you tip me
Rims on the car make it six feet, so I can park the car wherever the blimps be
I want a bird for my birthday, I drink syrup with no pancakes
Yeah, bitches round my pool, I make them hoe look like my landscape
Yeah, El Chapo J R R, multicolor A.R. rules
Looking like I play ball, tell 'em keep they day jobs

I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr

[Intro:]
Honorable
Honorable
Honorable C-Note
2 Chainz!

[Verse 1:]
I ain't never been a minute man
Pour a deuce in a minute maid
Trap house filled with ceilling fans
Weed louder than a hearing aid
Bitch same color as lemonade
We don't got to rent a renegade
And I [?] on a hunna
The only thing I might get is [?]
Tryna take another nigga's story
You a fuck nigga and I know it
See I could wear black in the summertime
And I could wear white when its snowin'
I could show you where to go like a local
Order 20 bags out of Oakland
I might buy me a motorcycle
And use your girl for a chauffeur
I'm the realest nigga and the illest nigga
Fuck you lil nigga and your lil sister
Try to use a nigga when it's beneficial
Free all my niggas out the penitentiary
Louis V all on my leggings
Bitch better get on my level
Put a half a milli in a MCM bag
Had that motherfucker looking pregnant

[Hook x4:]
Lapdance in the trap house
Get a lapdance off in the trap house

[Verse 2:]
Get a lapdance in the kitchen
Y'all sucka niggas pay attention
See I could make her ass bend over
At the same time make her do the dishes
Oh oh oh double middle finger to the picture
Handgun got a nose like Pippen
Girls come through they want to smoke
'Fore they leave this bitch they start strippin'
900 dollars for the tennis shoes
Get a lap dance in the living room
She about to turn to the jacuzzi
Cause the trap house don't got a swimming pool
Money piled up on the counter
Got a hundred round drum and an autocount
Got Ziploc bags and a digital scale and rubberbands all by the money counter
Got raid spray you know how the bugs be
Got a fan in the window by the love seat
And I know it was slow at work tonight
So bitch you better act like you love me

[Hook x4]

My mind for the intellectual
Had sex with her on my sectional
Slowed it down, take it extra slow
Bust on myself like plexi co
Oh alright here I go
Shorty got my love in the finger fold
I got a manicure, pedicure
I got her hair done and credit card new
I'm balling on her big time
Told shorty I'm 6'5"
Stand up on my bankroll, make me look like I'm 6'9"
She look like she been fine
She always call me big time
Pinky ring on, you should see the way I sip wine
I'm maestro in the main suite
Make a side chick out your main squeeze
Better hop on board 'fore the train leave
Shorty outta place cause I slang D
And I'm changes need my chain freeze
Meant to say my chain froze
Everytime I change clothes

[Hook - Betty Idol:]
Cherish the game
When we fly far away
Sky dive in a puddle of mud
Make it rain blue dolphin
All I see is blue dolphin
[x2]

I like when she smile
She like when I make her smile
She like when I put it down
She like when I come in town
I like when she on the brown
She like when I'm on the loud
Seen her take some coke then smile
Seen her take a perc then pow
Birkin bag see no salt
All on the beach with toes out
All on the beach sea gulls out
All in the jeep windows down
Where I come from the Regals out
She knows I turn up on the molly
She doing string thing for money
I'm trying to put it in her tummy
I might whisper in her earlobe
I'm blowing kisses in her earlobe
I'm telling things she ain't built for
Money long as Lincoln Continentals
Codeine with a touch of Sprite
Geeked up for a hundred nights
I'm a roll had a Cuban link
In a figaro this a finger roll

[Hook - Betty Idol:]
Cherish the game
When we fly far away
Sky dive in a puddle of mud
Make it rain blue dolphin
All I see is blue dolphin

Cherish the game
When we fly far away
Sky dive in a puddle of mud
Make it rain blue dolphin
All I see is blue dolphin

Money kinda short but we can work it out
Made a hundred tho (usand) In My Trap House
Bricks going in, Bricks going out

I'm tired of selling bricks I wanna go legit
I wonder can I sell 11 mill like 50 Cent
Cause platinum ain't enough I got too many vices
I love to smoke weed love to shoot dices
Say my life style extravagant I talk cash shit
Bitches say I'm arrogant well god damn Gucci cockie then
But at the same time young hoes be jocking slim
Gucci ain't shit, Bitch I beg your pardon

Smokin' rubber cushie

[Hook]

Jumped out the whip everybody looking
Big clouds of smoke but ain't nobody cooking
(females) (Girl their go Gucci Mane
I want his autograph 'cause I'm his biggest fan)
Yellow hummvie with the yellow feet
Yellow diamonds the same color as chedda cheese
And I'm smoking on that purple shit
They call me temp service 'cause I'll work a bitch
Money long like Shaq feet
Running dough like a sprinter at a track meet
I heard he got that soft white
Extended clips make them busters get they mind right

[Hook]

In my trap house watchin Sports Center
In the kitchen cooking but I ain't cooking dinner
Splash it with the water whip it make it harder
17 for 'em the same number as Qunice Carter
Say I'm working with wit a mill or better
Married to the game me and ?? live together
Street smart niggah never listen to the teacher
You can catch me in the bathroom smoking reefer
Prices low like Wal-Mart
Bricks on I-9 get ya shopping cart
Knee deep in the dope game
I'm not a farmer but I'm known to push them collard greens

[Hook]

[Chorus]
In the club tryin to find me a bad ass broad
Gave her five for the pussy then I took her to the mall
That's all babygirl thats all

Came up in the hood sellin fifty dollar slabs
Thats all playboy thats all

[Verse]
When them bottles start poppin girls start jockin 
The girl so fine that I took the chick shoppin
Dueces on the old school smokin on the dro fool

Shawty actin feisty too damn sheisty
Get wit Gucci mane baby u be so icy 
Can't lie baby girl you fine as hell

Baby says she like the way the top drop back
Never thought my home boy girl a jock like that

A mill worth of ice in these playa haters faces
A mill worth of ice in Gucci mane good gracious
Got a slick flow and I think its contagious

[Chorus]

[Verse]

Wit my chain so bright Ray charles might see
More ice on me than a game of hockey
If you want a mean dick you can ride my six
Suck a good dick then ill get your hair fixed 
Gucci brake bricks down used to sell fifties
Watch on my wrist man it cost a buck fifty
King of the city Gucciman Frank nitty 
Ill gives a bitch a dove if she let me touch her tities

[Chorus]

Gucci mane make you look lke you posed to look 
Gucci shoesGucci fit and a pocket book 
Let you party like a rock star, ride in boxcar
Have you gainin weight everyday eatin lobster
All your friends invited so u can bring a partner
Gucci in the hood sellin weed like a docter
Fifty dollar slab to a trunk full of holes
Never at the house cause im always doing shows 
Teamed up with big cat now they want to chit chat
Role to crash raod, flat shoals represent that
Gucci in the booth and my flows crazy 
Is it hot in here nigga or its just me
Have you at south beach fallin of Jet Ski
Smokin purple weed under shade of palm trees 
In Biloxi we could spend a hundred gees 
Ill play the crap table you get the slot machine

[Chorus]

[Chorus] 
Put on your booty shorts 
Ooh, I really like the sexy way you walk 
Ooh, I like the way you make your booty talk 
Everytime you put on your booty shorts

I don't throw dollars at girls, they throw dollars at me 
Gucci you conceited bitch I might be 
Cause my chain so bright Stevie Wonder might see 
Yea you got a man but ya man ain't me 
Add ya whole life savings times three 
The mouth full of dro and the clothes ain't free 
So you gotta be a dimepiece to approach me 
How much 'unh can one girl take 
How many cakes can one man bake 
Playa on the real man I don't know 
I just love it when they fresh and they ass cheeks show 
Everybody stare when I walk in the room 
Smokin on purp got me high like the moon 
Chain front big like its New Year's Eve 
But my Rollie on fire like the first day of June

[Chorus]

[Verse] 
I neva seen a chick wit a body like that 
Gucci Mane Lil Flap bitch I got it like that 
Stuntin in the club wit my nigga Big Kap 
Made the waitress come back wit 20 mo' stacks 
Iced out chain got a iced out grill

Shawty got some shorts on oh, so small 
Say she like me cause my rims real tall 
If you want work bitch you can call us

Old school Chevy same color cocaine 
Ridin through the hood throwin money out the brain 
And I'm lookin for the girls wit the booty shorts mane

[Chorus]

[Verse] 
Candy Escalade 26 inch blades 
Throw back money from back in eighth grade 
Ya dancin in the club so I know ya get paid 
But I betcha you'd look betta wit these microbraids 
Girls in the club like dat there stank 
Showin off three or four rubberband banks 
Me and HB keep a big bankroll pulled up in a Hemi wit the Lambo Doors 
Me and yo chick in a red corvette 
I neva had shit nigga what ya expect 
Neva seen a young man paint so wet hood rich and my album ain't even dropped yet 
You'll neva see a man wit a watch like mine 
Face real pretty and a body real fine 
When we get home I'm a break her spine 
Get in her ear and corrupt her mind

Maybe the ice in my ear, or my bracelet 
But she look like the type that could take a dick 
Young Gucci Mane, don't kiss me baby u can kiss my chain 
Ya gotta be a dime piece,

Waitin on the bitches, holla at the bitches
Never worked for Church's but I served a lot of chickens
Got a lot of G's so I do a little trickin
Hoe take this lil' money bitch and go on about ya business
Every day is Christmas, every night is Valentine's
Ten in New York, it's nine Alabama time
Moved to A-T-L, the whole East Atlanta mine
Billion dollar deal, I signed on the dotted line
Gucci 'bout to pimp shit, lobster steak and shrimp shit
Big Cat, Laflare, you try and get your wig split

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
They say my chain so cold, but my watch too hot
My earrings bling, pinkie ring on fire
Twinkle twinkle, see the stars pass by
Gucci Mane ain't hot? Youse a God damn liar
Why ask why? Niggaz go Bud Dry
A case of Cristal and a black fo'-five
Hoes in the club like "Who is that guy?
Drinkin Cristal throwin money in the sky?"
His fit so sharp and his wheels so large
The rims keep spinnin but the car stay parked
Fo' bedroom with the two car garage
Gucci just copped, nigga I ain't got a flaw
Wet paint job and the automatic start
Semi-automatic if you try to play hard
Gucci Mane Montana, from East Atlanta
Bitch the diamonds in my chain same color bananas

Titties showing like Hooters
I’m the plug tryna serve all the cocaine users
I’m an East Atlanta nigga we don’t really like strangers
Selling dope so big fit your whole fore finger
I’m an East Atlanta nigga we don’t really like strangers
If your girl like rich niggas I suggest you don’t bring her

[Young Scooter:]

Keep lil nuke with me every day, yeah he’ll lay your ass down
This a Southside beat but I’m from the east side
When I was on the block working you lil niggas couldn’t come outside
That ain’t his whip, that’s devil ride, but I was on the driver’s side
Rest in peace to OGD, I wish my nigga was still alive

[Gucci Mane:]
On the block eating noodles

Selling dope so big fit your whole four fingers

Lets grow a hunnid pack and wrap em one by one just like a mummy
I love my bitch but I don't love nothing the way I love my money
Ten thousand rounds of ammo at the spot, man I wish they would
The freaks come out at night and the killas in my neck of the woods
Let my boy murk em and give em a apartment in baton rouge

I still can’t get you out my mind
I think about you all the time
I recognize you on the grind
Well I still want to make you mine
I want to fuck you from behind
I want to kiss you one more time
We broke up, felt like I’m dying
I said I didn’t but I was lying
Baby remember how we shine
We never once stood in a line
We smoking kush and sipping wine
My bitch so motherfucking fly
Look, we smoking kush and sipping wine
I want to fuck you from behind
She used to be my ride or die
But fly little butterfly, fly, fly
My bitch so motherfucking fly

She used to be my ride or die
I want to look her in her eyes
And tell her fly fly fly
I know you living in the sky
But baby girl so do I
You balling hard and so do I
I think it’s time you recognize

[RiFF RAFF:]
Hair by Versace, jump out the big body
Pomegranate Maserati, seats green, Wasabi
Tiger gold and emblems, rose gold from dentist
Massage by [?] Clayborn, collect call from [?]
Married life is boring, my house is four stories
Tell ghost stories to Coly, then [?] plans in France
Two months in advance, shower big enough for eight
Pour a seven in my grape Fanta, second glance, diamonds dancing
Diamonds dancing in New Hampshire

She used to be my ride or die
I want to look her in her eyes
And tell her fly fly fly
I know you living in the sky
But baby girl so do I
You balling hard and so do I
I think it’s time you recognize

It's Gucci
OK

We're Going In

[Hook - Gucci Mane:]
It's a Cold Day
I need somebody to lay with
I already got a lot of money to play with

It's a Cold Day
And this old brother crazy
I got all these bricks in my lil mama basement
It's a Cold Day

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane:]
I'm a Gucci Mane, gotta get them
Got me rapping to a whole 'nother rhythm
It's side-tipping, fat Gucci gotta struggle
But I ain't finna say who did him
Imma put a little change on hitting him
Got Rottweiler goons, I'll sip 'em
I'll split 'em, we can get another victim
In a room with a Boa Constrictor
I ripped your ex before I picked her
My mental, my pistol
My sticker is sicker
My mixtape go get 'em
Got badass hoes, I pick 'em
Put all my change on shitting 'em
Imma drive without the lights
Talking like it's hype
Get wheels and a new system
If a nigga hating on me, kiss 'em
Cause I ain't got time now to diss 'em
Imma pull up to The Chi
Get in the parking lot
But none of my fans gonna miss him
Imma tell a nigga playing to sipper
I bust a nigga head, no pimper
I shoot a bullet in the temple
This a day he won't remember

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane:]
You see, this is a train crash
How long will the fame last?
Who cares? Teacher came to class
"Gucci" on my name-tag
I'm snatching the game back
You might get your chain snatched
You try me, get aimed at
Zone 6, you can blame that
And death is the penalty
There's so many men in these
I'm smoking my enemies
Like our sales are, visibly
The GB I hunt
Think I'm laundered with money
Cause I got twenties and fifties
And I got plenty of hundreds
If I lose on the gamble
Then that ain't nothing to me
I could stand alone
Cause I'm the boss of the streets
I'm a cold-blooded veteran
Yeses to a freshman. Test me
You might end up serving me refreshments

[Hook x2]


It's Gucci!
Catch Up!

I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets

I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane:]
I got fat pockets
I don't like a wallet
I got fat pockets
Money in the closet
I got fat pockets
About three deposits
Hundred-fifty k
Haters can't stop it
Money and the power
Think I'm selling powder
Sipping drank, got me leaning
Like the Eiffel Tower
Money in the shower
Hundreds getting wet
Sell it to you wet
I'm all about a check
My pockets got the mumps like Professor Klump
Gucci on the run, put a shorty in a slump
I'm in the barn, so the front? Yeah, that's where the trunk
And I'm so hood, park the 'rari, come back, hit a gump
(Catch up!)

[Hook - Gucci Mane:]

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane:]
See the [?] love the bands in my [?] pants
Hundred grands will for dead, old white man
Yellow Rear, Drop-top, it's the redskins
Enough jewelry to make a young bitch's head spin
Haters mad, looking at me like "It's you again!"
And niggas only at the top, but I can buy friends
I got some twins in the back, think I'm a fly man
And when they land, it's a movie or a drive-in
And I don't see these pissy niggas like a blind man
It's East Atlanta, but I nicknamed it The Crimeland
And my bank account pregnant from my right hand
And my crew get wasted like a walkman

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Gucci Mane:]
Out with the bird, park on the curb
Still get paid on the first and the third
Splurge with an urge, goons on the go
Waiting on Gucci Mane just to give them the word
Verse for the eight I murder in the parking lot
Big blunts of kush I spark a lot
All except for his legs, sticking out
Park that bitch in the 6 a lot
Hundreds in my pocket, they falling out
Every little week, I'm balling out
Top-drop, bay is falling down
On Pea-Tree Avenue I'm falling down
On pancakes. This rough snake
Sliding round on a [?]
Like a hovercraft, giving all the girls
Wish my gran' could see me now
Big Kid say he want to be me now
Tell the truth, I wanna be me too
Want a fly on the wall with a bird's eye view
My whole life should've been pay-per-view
Rock solid, make good profit
But I wish I had like ten pockets
Thugged out, then plugged in
I think I got like ten sockets

[Hook]

Because I'm grinding
Got this shining
Tell my cuz,[?]
That I love him

Tell my cuz,[?]
That I love him

Tell my cuz,[?]
That I love him

Because I'm grinding
Got this shining
Tell my cuz [?]
That I love him

Well shoot the house apart
Shit, burn it down and call it justice

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane:]
So holla at the bustas if you looking for a sucker
They [?] and the body [?]
Gucci!
Cocaine white as dairy
Provided by Dirty Harry
I bet you call me dirty when I spun this for the Marys
The pounds got me married to my negro for the cabbage
I'm living lavish, gambling houses look like Caesar's Palace
Gucci!
Driving to the hole, I'll pull up on your for the J
I'm dirty when I play, I might boss over for the Tre
Gucci going postal, coast to coast about my mail
I break you playing CeeLo, then I buy your drawers- Chapelle
I'm higher than Stone Mountain and my penguin like a fountain
My boy down in [place name] will leave your heart somewhere, not pounding

[Hook:]
Gucci gamble!
I keep a pocket full of hundreds like I'm finna gamble
My hundred-fifty in my duffel, finna buy a Lambo
Your life ain't worth the shambles
You'll try me? That's a gamble
Ay, I'll beat your team, case a nigga want to gamble

I keep a pocket full of hundreds like I'm finna gamble
My hundred-fifty in my duffel, 'bout to cop a Lambo
Your life ain't worth the shambles
You'll try me? That's a gamble
Ay, I'll beat your team, case a nigga want to gamble

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane:]
Nigga try fluids!
My chick is well Jewish
All white beads and the light shine blue-ish
Money, money money. I'm making love to it
A thousands pounds, a million. You know I'm gonna move it
You know it in the summer. Raining in the club
Fuck, I'm off to get your diamonds, I just spent a fucking load
Drop a grand in six seconds. Tell a bitch to bounce
She'll find out there I bought a ward that's thicker than a house
My closet like the Gucci store
I am such a coochie whore
Gucci glasses, Gucci bag, I gotta go and get some more
I'm gonna roll the dice and hope that I don't crap out
Can't through my hand in, I'm too low down

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Gucci Mane:]
We can reconvene at a place that's more serene
In [?] I'm a God. In Alabama I'm a king
In Georgia I'm a boss. In Las Vegas I'm a baller
And he's a ballerina, dodging bullets like a dodger
Shout out to the bloggers. I know I'm a problem
I'm scrubbed like Super Contra, so tell the fucking robbers
I'm incontami-crazy, diamonds blinking out my pinkie
I'm inky in the water, guess that's why the hoes' so kinky
You're wrinkly, dinky stinky. Wrapping labels underneath me
Now you being nasty. Dissing when you cannot beat me
I'm still undefeated, and that's an honest statement
But I speak it and I preach it, so fuck all of you leeches

[Hook]


[Intro - Peewee Longway:]

Tell him Louie chasing and he feel like no one else
Tell him Peewee Longway say he feel like no one else
Tell him big Guwop say that he feel like no one else
Tell him little Guwop say that he feel like no one else
When I copped that Rover, man, I drove like no one else
When he called it out, I bet he drove like no one else
When he bought a Phantom, bet he drove like no one else
When your ho leave Guwop bet she feel like no one else

[Verse 1 - Young Thug:]
I got a bad bitch, said that she feel like nobody
And no vampire, but I got boyfriends divided
Made a hundred k I'm rapping, rapping, that my habit
Now you meet the newest member of the goddamn library
This monkey bitch crabbing, so I guess I know her partner
I don't know her, but she say she know the mother of my daughter
I'm not talking 'bout no dad, but we don't have to go farther
I don't care, but if you ever need booze, I take your hard-earned
I look just like my middle name, that ass fat from a mile away
I got my mother's friends, I like that pussy bald head
I'm thugger, major pain, I put that icing on her grill
Just like Johnny Dang, Johnny Dang, Hallelujah!

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Peewee Longway:]
When I'm in the house, it's Longway feeling like no one else
Got your bitch into her vest and call that Peewee Longway health
Now roll my weed, that stuff two grams
We fucked up, two cups in the fountain
Lord, that ain't us, that's country grammar
Talking like a country boy, I stay in Atlanta
Y'all niggas ain't know I sell mud out the fountain
Clienteles'll get your ass scrubbed in Atlanta
Skinny Beretta on [?], don't scrub in the Audi
UK, foreign whip, don't know a nigga like it
Switch a royal k, bitch, I thought a nigga like it
Guwop, Guap and Thug in the posse
Ain't shit like us, cause we going in your pockets
Boot it up, nigga, took off like a rocket
We the plug in the socket. Taking nigga's bitch is a hobby
Run around the motherfucking lobby. Woppa and Thug
Back to back serving in the 'rari
Got racks that are older than Atari. Guwop and the bud
Jeffing out the plug with a thousand
Brick Factory count up a thousand
Sipping mud out the mug, white phone stuck
A nigga whiling, you'll never see another nigga like it

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Gucci Mane:]
They say I walk like cash, and I talk too fast
Girl to the mall yeah I bought her two bags
Gucci Mane tryna sell more houses
Don’t give a damn that I used to sell ounces
My block be my trap house, that was powerful
Sell a man's apartment, shit, to make housing
Gucci is the God, man, you don't want to start it
Have the world. We'll say "Dearly Departed"
All she wrote
Bend her and hanging. Fat give her [?] quote end quote
I sell dope, I cut coat
Especially if that ass BOAT Imma keep it up [?]
I'm the captain, all aboard
Come on while you can afford it
If I ain't rapping I'd be working
Is that hard for you to absorb?
For the free monkeys from me
Serve it to you dirty cheap
Dirty dog, dirty job, so Imma charge you thirty-three
Serve to check my style, yeah, you stole it like a burglary
Now I'm on emergency I keep on making currencies

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Peewee Longway:]
OK, now when she on that molly she turn to somebody else
She so rich as fuck she tried to do it by herself
I told her it's Versace, watch how you pulling on that belt
And these are Christians loose, now that's a rack everytime I step
I'm with Longway, I'm with [?], pull an eight up by myself
Pull up in that foreign feature 'rari, hop out and just sit
Touchdown in LA, turned seventeen, got they injection
I seen Guwop call up Birdman, say 100k a bet
Why everytime you see the kid I'm with another nigga's bitch?
I might shoot a k with choppers, you can tell they with the shit
I don't give a fuck about it, she get fucked then get this mince
Smoking weed and sipping lean, designer down behind the tent

[Hook:]
I got money stacks
Like dirty clothes
I love the kids
But I don't love the hoes
Four wit ya, boi
Show wit ya folks
She say she love me
But she just love rolls
I got money stacks
Like dirty clothes
And I don't love her
She love my dirty dros
And if the game screwed up
I'm bought to flip it on
And I got pounds of blow
And sixty pounds of gold

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane:]
R.I.P to my old hoes, say hello to my new friends
Bad chick with the red bottoms, we pull up in a brand new Benz
Feel this whip like shorty, low. I got foolish money, little shorty knows
My money growing like a Chia pet, our first date was [?]
Our second date was [?] steak, our third date was hella great
Hella money, I said hella weight
I got a bit of steak, with a huge lake
Helicopter with a pilot, Maybach with a driver
Bedroom with a kitchen in it, might wake up and cook a [?]
Our deuce up on four weight
Got short money, it's no plate
Got fifty pounds off that gas pay
You can smell this shit from the driveway
Tore this shit in like two days, been waiting on it like nine days
I'm a truck nigga, scream "living legend"
Get my grass clipping like Nine Jays

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane:]
I came up from a fifty slab
I'm bad when angered, but good with mail
I'm a test code, trying to catch a truck
I'm the Mad Hatter, trying to catch a kale
Well they lock me up and then let me go
I'm balling on ya like Mexico
Yellow bands, got collard greens, got all good kinds of vegetables
I'm highly paid and successful
Imma cook it up and get ass-crushed
Got a bank-roll, no pressure
Ain't the old me, I won't scratch ya
Professor teaching lectures
Bet the poor love this semester
Might learn something if you listen to it
Get new Berries, do Delta
I'm a go-getter, I'm a gold killer
She ain't doing it, and I let her
I ain't finished living, you painting pictures
On talking to my investors
I'm walking round, I'm talking loud
I'm smoking loud, got shelter
Your side of town, my side of town
My bird fly in the weather

[Hook]

"On The Reg"

[Intro - Gucci Mane:]
On the regular
Cause I'm not regular
This beat ain't regular
My style ain't

[Hook - Gucci Mane:]
Walking magic city on the motherfucking regular
(Regular, Regular)
I throw up money, king of diamonds, Monday on the regular
(Regular, Regular)
Jamaican kush I'm rolling up, cause I don't fuck with regular
(Regular, Regular)
Import my hoes from overseas, cause all my hoes ain't regular
(Regular, Regular)

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane:]
All my hoes regular, all my hoes are purdy
Absurd with these nouns and verbs. I be squeezing words
That ain't words. That seem crazy to you, but it still appeal
My dog, you got thirty years if you don't appeal
I don't need a deal, cause I cash out on the regular
I don't deal with debit cards, I don't fuck with credit ones
All I do is talk money, cause Gucci got et cetera
Kicked out my competitors, so ain't nobody better, bruh
Baby girl like regular, all normal niggas scared of her
But everything I do is abnormal, my life is spectacular
Don't know what attracted her, but I got a bachelor pad
And I got your girlfriend, cause you laying down, I beating her

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane:]
Gucci Mane la flair, extra-ordinaire
Player, leave you choosing like a bear
At the fucking county fair
I swear that it ain't fair, cause I know that he a square
When we gonna take our places, baby I can take you there
And no, you not prepared when I walk up in the 'were
Could have come from a whole 'nother hemisphere
Now let's get it clear, all these diamonds in my ear
Make it hard for me to steer when you're kissing down there
I had a blast last night, I had to tip the driver
Cause the shit I've seen last night could have been on MacGuyver
Doors suicidal, so that shit was homicidal
You never seen the ghost? I guess you never seen me riding

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Gucci Man:e]
She can't fit in my schedule
Because that shit she got ain't special, bruh
I guess it's kind of scary to her
Because that shit I do ain't usual
Yeah, I smash her on the casual
My money make me more attractable
But this shit ain't nothing non-negotiable
This Bricksquad crew and we ain't sociable
She wanna elope. No! I'm dragging my flip, bro
Who say I'm not a heart breaker telling a sad joke?
Ain't regular, no way, I'm tipping up, ballet
I need some green cards, Immigrants in my driveway

[Hook]

[Intro:]
Make this shit nigga just spaz out, fly
Burr!
OK. See your Gucci checking in
Time to go hard or go home


[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane:]
Riding round the city in a two-seater
Got enough ice on for two people
Kush, near my two liter
No shirt on just a wife-beater
Quicker on the draw than an art teacher
Talking out loud like proud preachers
Pistol in my arm-reacher
King-sized switcher with some nice reefer
Hood are a-smashing the white people
We on your track, that's a nice feature
Test on my face like nine needles
Scratch like a nigga got nine heaters
No national, the Grand National
Bitches sucking me like Dracula
Flipping these hoes like spatulas
Coming down the hill, it's spectacular
Control the rock and unload the crop
And get it out soon as you hit the loading dock
Barbershop, cause of the shady boss
Bitch I'm back so good you couldn't tell or not
You can smell the knot, you can tell I'm hot
Snitching-ass niggas running to the feds a lot
Pardon, man, cause the hoes give head a lot
But if a nigga find out, he getting read about

[Hook:]
My dogs be dragging them hoes
My dogs be dragging them hoes
My dogs be dragging them hoes
My dogs be dragging them hoes
My dogs be dragging them hoes
My dogs be dragging them hoes
My dogs be dragging them hoes
My dogs be dragging them hoes

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane:]
Niggas on the outside, looking. They trying to peep in
Me I'm on the inside, cooking or trying to sleep in
Kitchen full of raw ass chickens, like it was Church's
Hood full of clown-ass niggas, this shit's a circus
Who thinking Macs not hot? I be the leader
Park my shit in front of the school like I'm the teacher
Trying make this dope get hard, that's an erection
Only thing a nigga need now is a connection
West on the mean "You Gucci? I'm cooking fishes."
"Pounds in the trashbag. Gucci, go do the dishes."
Money on my mind, that summer job shit was petty
I'm thinking this summer what color I'll paint the Chevy

[Hook]


[Hook - Gucci Mane:]
Me and you bitch get along
What is you saying, homes?
You and money don't get along
What is you saying, homes?
I'm on the road, always gone
Where is you staying, homes?
You niggas macho, ain't get cash
What is you saying, homes?

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane:]
Wrestling with the working figure for the dopeman
Hell yeah, Gucci Mane applaud, but used to be the dopeman
I had to search them niggas down, 'fore the money change hands
If you thinking of jacking Gucci, you fuckers better change plans
My buddy say he found God and that he's a changed man
I whipped the dope so hard it jumped to thirty-eight grams
You shopping with the middle-man, what you got thirty-eight hands?
I got a thirty-eight special so I'm aiming at heads

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane:]
Nighttime in the hood, but my wrist glowing
I got your auntie smoke that pipe, yeah she been blowing
And you ain't gotta call, [?] where your bitch going
Drop 'rari in the hood, got the tits showing
She kick it with me the long way, yeah she feel going
Stupid racks in the wall, yeah they bill doing
She say that you can't pay the bills, let the bitch do it
And even you can get some money, it ain't shit to it

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3 - Gucci Mane:]
Tell me what you saying, homes
Then play it right, you played it wrong
Got a badass bitch that stayed at home
And you're home alone and on your own
Motherfuck you. Have a destitution, pump your list and call my phone
R.I.P to Pimp C, diss me and you gonna smell my cologne
Ain't no word 'bout casualties
Ain't no dead without tragedies
You standing by the block with me
But your bitch still wanna talk with me
I know the feds wanna shackle me
Dopeboys in my properties
Put a hundred Gs in your bitch house
But don't spend that shit without asking me

[Hook x2]

[Hook - Gucci Mane:]
I used to know her
I used to know her
I used to know her
I used to know her
Says she got another nigga, but I used to know her
Says she got a man now, but I used to know her

I used to know her
I used to know her
I used to know her
I used to know her
Says she got another nigga, but I used to know her
Says she got a man now, but I used to know her

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane:]
I used to know this little thirsty ho named Nessa
Bills came in two hundreds
She asked for our help
So Gucci super-fly guy
Call me Young Delta
And the pussy stupid wet still, cause I just left her
Shorty got a trunk backed out
The Lord bless her
Kitchen table to the shower
To the bedroom dresser
Headbanging on the headboard
Yeah, I knelt her
And her body stupid banging
But her head something special

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane:]
I used to know her
I know I know her
She was such a good soldier, very loyal
Used to text me all the time, but I did ignore her
That's why she acting like she don't
But she know I know her
They call me Mr Badman
I'm a money thrower
I'm throwing bones, go for money like I'm Brodie Croyle
I got your girl with me, late night on that oil

He drive a Ford Explorer

[Hook]

A nigga pill with him
And the money

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane:]
I might wake up and count my money just to turn my swag up
Swag and OG bags of gas help me run my cash up
They tried to laugh at me, but Bugga help me get the last laugh
I got at your ranch styles, nigga, I got a tippy-tall stash
I can pause, replay a nigga in your motherfucking lip
But them niggas and them shitting and went through the hood, no good
What's a skrippa to a motherfucking million dollar nigga?
Big Guwop, hands off me, nigga, you know I'll go sneak in with this pistol
I'm just walking 'round the club leaving traces of blood
Drinking lean out the mug, got a four in my jug
Cold slugs in my mouth, nigga shout out to Thug
Ain't took a shower in three days, hundred keys in the tub

[Hook - Gucci Mane:]
Sixty Thousand dollars everytime my phone ring
Super-bad bitch, she just dropped off another fourteen
Quarter million dollars, spent that on that wine ring
In a ring full of lions, I'm the Lion King

Sixty Thousand dollars everytime my phone ring
Super-bad bitch, she just dropped off another fourteen
Quarter million dollars, spent that on that wine ring
In a ring full of lions, I'm the Lion King

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane:]
And I boss you like a ring, Guwop got a ring to it
I feel like the king, put the hook on and Kareem through it
Fancy footwork on my queen, might do it like a king do it
In 95, I bought a regal man that was clean Buick
You ain't find another ho moving
Beat your featured mood, ho
Move your shoes, you know you ain't gonna do it do no
If a bunch of bees was trying to sting ya, I would through a rock at you
Big Guwop got stupid Guap and got more blocks than a brothel got
I don't put no trust in no ho, cause they run they mouth a lot
That's your big homie? Then why the fuck he wear a [?] top
We go out and ball a lot, singers that the army got
She shot the whole navy cause her boyfriend tried to save her life

[Hook]

[Intro - Chief Keef:]
Hello?
Yeah?
What up?
Nothing
You dry
Its 3 o'clock in the morning out here
How? Ah its 3 hour difference doe, never mind

[Interlude - Gucci Mane:]
You’re running through my mind
I think about you all the time
You motivate my grind
You shine, I shine, we shine
What you've done to me
Girl come have some fun with me
What you want from me?
Please don’t get scared
Don’t run from me
Walking on the beach
And then my lil mama a freak
S-someday's I can't wait
Yeah we fucking, constantly

[Hook - Gucci Mane:]
I'm a star, being humble now
Parking brand new car
Ballin' hard, like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
With my broad
Constantly crossing the country
Constantly getting the money
You niggas haten' constantly
But I don’t take it personally
Thirty G's a verse from me
Your baby daddy work for me
And I am not ashamed to say
And I think about my family constantly

[Verse 1 - Chief Keef:]
Your friend constantly h
Hitting my phone! Constantly
These feds steady tapping my phone
Think they onto me
I be getting money, spending money, constantly
Continue to hate on me
I swear that shit don’t bother me, aye!
Smoke OG no bubbly
And I smoke that shit constantly
I fuck hoes constantly and I rock shows constantly
Baby why you joking, I don’t play?
These niggas jokes I'm out of space and I'm a spade
Every time she whine, I'm like, “OK?”
I don’t want to hear that shit, not today
Let me check my watch
24 in a day and its 12 up in my watch
Ain't no time to waste
Got some cake to make
She want to see me
I told that bitch another day!

[Hook - Gucci Mane]

[Hook:] 
Don't leave my rhyming too long
Don't leave my rhyming too long
I have my mind blown: too gone
If you leave my rhyming too long

Stretching pain out on myself, last night I was whiling out
Took so much damn Ace of Spades, woke up on somebody's couch
Now I'm 'bout to throw a party. Who party right at the house?
Though I smoke at least half an ounce, so many blunts that I lost count
Now I'm wasted, loaded, bitch crazy, drunk, high, landed, rolling
Talking like a loco-motive, tell 'em four pounds' the quota
She hoping going blowing on pussy-ness that's so explosive
House white with steel, ho I'm not a man to show no emotion
I got pornographic pictures in my iPad
Oh that's your bitch? I fucked her, nigga. My bad!
So if you fuck my girl, we'll be even Steven
But the difference 'bout me Imma keep it pimping

Don't leave my rhyming too long
Don't leave my rhyming too long
I have her smoking on that real strong
If you leave my rhyming too long

[Hook:] 
Don't leave my rhyming too long
Don't leave my rhyming too long
I have my mind blown: too gone
If you leave my rhyming too long

Back in at the West end, I'm sipping on a Martini
Yellow Lamborghini, 'bout the same color as a zucchini
Last night was a movie, I woke up with three women
Got two chains,two bracelets, she riding me and she getting it
On the fly-ti got a high price, this a lavish life, but I live it
Take your shots right like it's fight night all night long and no twisting
They searched me when I came in, so I came in with three pistols
That jewelry on and my money long, but don't bother me cause I'm chilling
Got three hoes on solo, but trust me no tripping
Ain't acting like I ain't in there, I'm on the stage, I'm tipping
Talk cashier, don't gift it, get dope high, I'm lifted
Sip real lean, that codeine. Who got them descriptions?

Don't leave my rhyming too long
Don't leave my rhyming too long
I have her smoking on that real strong
If you leave my rhyming too long

[Hook:] 
Don't leave my rhyming too long
Don't leave my rhyming too long
I have my mind blown: too gone
If you leave my rhyming too long
